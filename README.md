# YNAB-Automation

This script is a Python script that fetches email data from a Gmail account using IMAP protocol, extracts the required data and stores it in a list. It also categorizes the expenses using a predefined dictionary of payee and category names, and uses the fuzzywuzzy library to match the descriptions to the predefined payees. It then sends the data to YNAB (You Need A Budget) using its API to categorize the expenses in the budget.

You can deploy this in Google Cloud on Google Functions and use Google Cloud scheduler to run it every 30 Mins

P.S Just remember to uncomment Main function and indent the code while deploying
